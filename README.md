# scientistmetrics : Python library for measure the degree of association

## About scientistmetrics

**scientistmetrics** is a `Python` python package for calculating correlation amongst categorical variables.

## Why scientistmetrics?

The project started due to the lack of reliable source code to calculate degree of association between two nominal variables.

The function provides the option for computing one of three measures of association between two nominal variables from the data given in a 2d contingency table: Tschuprow’s T, Pearson’s Contingency Coefficient and Cramer’s V.
